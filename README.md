**Objective:** Perform the needed data cleaning steps to visualize data from superstore.csv in D3. Conduct a comprehensive data analysis and generate visual representations that encapsulate the essence of the dataset, without looking at the data.

Process: Produced 2 data visualizations for dartmouth courses from 2021 to 2022. After looking within the csv, I highlighted the few data columns based on departments, Median GPA, and enrollments. Based on these variables, I noticed the high number of observations which could be summarized based on grouping methods. From the visualizations in the Developer Challenge from last year, there was chart reductivity but not much story telling. In this visualization I looked to determine how the number of students enrolled in a department affects the GPA of the department. I wanted to combine this hypothesis with the idea that STEM majors typically will have departments where the GPA is lower than average  a great deal of the visualization would involve numerical values based on the total profits and sales. I calculated the total Profits based on each state and produced a color pallete to create distinctions between profit values.

Conclusion: After producing the data visualization I noted that the 3 major states with the highest profit were New York, California, and Michigan while the 3 states with the lowest profit were Texas, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Additionally, with the hover function, users can view the values of a state's quantity of products, average discount values and sales values.

Challenges: After finally concluding the choropleth visualizations, I found it hard to choose between this visualization and Screenshot (11) since the other graph contains slightly differnt legend values and highlighted more negative values. Because of the wide range of values within the data set and overall more values being positive, I chose to go with larger range of values for the legend producing a more gradual shift between range values.

Produced these visualization, allowing for a toggle function between graphs
